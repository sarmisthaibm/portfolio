<h2>Project Name 01<br>
    RJ45 CRIMPING TOOL
</h2>
<p>Crimpers are tools used to make cold weld joints between two wires or a wireand   aconnector,   such   as   lugs.   Ideally,   the   electrical   and   mechanicalproperties of the weld joint are as strong as the parent materials.<br><br> Crimpingtools are sized according to the wire gauges (using AWG -  American WireGauge) they can accept. Some come with interchangeable  die heads  thatallow for a wider range of wire sizes and connectors.How to use:<br><br> First you will need to strip the length of wire that you want tocrimp. Then, attach the connector. For crimping tools with interchangeabledies, you will need to select the right die head for the connector by matchingwire   gauge   ratings. <br>  For   dieless   crimpers,   you   will   need   to   match   to   theproper groove. Finally, apply pressure, take out the newly crimped connector,and give a few tugs to make sure you have a solid and secure connection.</p>

        Introduction to PC ASSEMBLING & DEASSEMBLING
    </h1>
    <p>In today's video we are going to Learn and understand about PC Assembling & Disassembling. We'll also practically see that how we can set up different parts of PC later.

        What are the benefits of Assembling a PC by our own? Reasons are given below :<br><br>
        • We can further update our Harddisk, RAM or Processor according to our requirement if we have assembled PC by our own. Branded systems not to provide upgradation of System.
        • Following are some of the important parts which needs to be bought for assembling a PC by our own :<br><br>
        - System Fan
        - Floppy disk (not compulsory)
        - Motherboard
        - Processor
        Following are some of the Tools which are compulsorily required for Assembling and Disassembling the parts which we have bought for our PC :
        - A Magnetic Screwdriver Set
        - Needle nose Pliers<br>
        
        
        Following is the step by step method which we should follow while assembling a PC :
        • Install Case fan
        • Install SMPS
        • Install Motherboard, Microprocessor
        • Install Heat sink.</p>

<h1>Projects Name 03<br>
CISCO PACKET TRACER</h1> 
<p>You can also find a data structure project that makes it easy to park a car, as well as a Cisco packet tracing project , UIUX designs and some GUI's using Python programming language Using Cisco Packet Tracer we have implemented a sample network design for a bank I'm currently preparing for my CCNA 200-301 Exam.</p>
